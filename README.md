## What's New — v0.1.7

- **Benchmark harness**: end-to-end `WaggleAdapter` connecting the graph engine to ConvoMem / MemBench runners with automated exact-match scoring and latency logging.
- **LongMemEval integration**: CLI-driven ingestion and retrieval evaluation against the official LongMemEval split (held-out `81.6% R@5`).
- **Logging utilities**: structured log helpers (`logging_utils`) for consistent, level-aware output across all subsystems.
- **Evidence tracking**: new `evidence.py` module records source provenance on stored nodes so reasoning chains are fully traceable.
- **Observability stack**: Grafana dashboard, Prometheus config, and Docker Compose overlay in `deploy/observability/`.
- **Kubernetes manifests**: production-grade `deployment.yaml`, network policy, external-secret, and certificate templates under `deploy/kubernetes/`.
- **Operational runbooks**: incident response, secret management, API-key rotation, and onboarding guides added to `docs/runbooks/`.

---

## Who is this for?

**→ Individual developer** extending Claude, Codex, Cursor, or Antigravity with persistent memory:
`pip install waggle-mcp && waggle-mcp init` and you're done. SQLite + local embeddings, zero infra.

**→ Team running a shared memory service:** Waggle ships with a Docker image, Kubernetes manifests, Prometheus metrics, and multi-tenant auth. See [deploy/kubernetes/](./deploy/kubernetes/) and [docs/runbooks/](./docs/runbooks/).

Both paths share the same MCP tool surface — the difference is only the backend and transport.

---

## Why waggle-mcp?

`waggle-mcp` is a local-first memory layer for MCP-compatible AI clients, built on a persistent knowledge graph. It gives your AI a persistent knowledge graph it can read and write through any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, etc.).

| Stuffed context | Structured retrieval |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Huge prompts every session | Compact subgraph retrieved at query time |
| Session-local memory | Persistent multi-session memory |
| Flat notes and chunks | Typed nodes and edges: decisions, reasons, contradictions |
| "What changed?" requires replaying logs | Temporal queries and diffs are first-class |

Waggle often uses materially fewer tokens than naive chunked retrieval on factual lookups, while graph-traversal queries intentionally spend more context to include reasoning chains such as updates, contradictions, and dependencies.

---

## Quick start

```bash
pip install waggle-mcp
waggle-mcp init
# Restart your MCP client. Done.
```

`init` detects your MCP client, writes its config, and creates the local database directory. Default mode is local SQLite with on-device embeddings. Antigravity and manual configuration details are in [docs/reference.md](./docs/reference.md).

Manual MCP setup examples for **Codex**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Antigravity** are in [docs/reference.md](./docs/reference.md#manual-client-configuration).

> **⚠️ Edges are what make graph memory work.**
> `observe_conversation` and `decompose_and_store` create edges automatically.
> If you only call `store_node`, you get isolated facts — not a connected graph.
> Always prefer `observe_conversation` for conversational ingestion.

---

## Setting Up waggle as an MCP Server

> **One-time install:** `pip install waggle-mcp` — no API key, no cloud account, no Docker required for local use.

Pick your client below, paste the config, and restart. That's it.

### Antigravity

Open the agent panel → `···` menu → **Manage MCP Servers** → **View raw config**, then add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "waggle": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "waggle.server"],
      "env": {
        "WAGGLE_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "WAGGLE_BACKEND": "sqlite",
        "WAGGLE_DB_PATH": "~/.waggle/memory.db",
        "WAGGLE_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID": "local-default",
        "WAGGLE_MODEL": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Config file location:
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "waggle": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "waggle.server"],
      "env": {
        "WAGGLE_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "WAGGLE_BACKEND": "sqlite",
        "WAGGLE_DB_PATH": "~/.waggle/memory.db",
        "WAGGLE_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID": "local-default",
        "WAGGLE_MODEL": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add waggle \
  --env WAGGLE_TRANSPORT=stdio \
  --env WAGGLE_BACKEND=sqlite \
  --env WAGGLE_DB_PATH=~/.waggle/memory.db \
  --env WAGGLE_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID=local-default \
  --env WAGGLE_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
  -- python -m waggle.server
```

### Cursor

`Cursor Settings → Features → MCP Servers → + Add`:
- **Command:** `python`
- **Args:** `-m waggle.server`
- **Env vars:** same block as Claude Desktop above

Or drop a `.cursor/mcp.json` at the project root using the same `mcpServers` JSON shape.

### Codex

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.waggle]
command = "python"
args    = ["-m", "waggle.server"]
env     = {
  WAGGLE_TRANSPORT         = "stdio",
  WAGGLE_BACKEND           = "sqlite",
  WAGGLE_DB_PATH           = "~/.waggle/memory.db",
  WAGGLE_DEFAULT_TENANT_ID = "local-default",
  WAGGLE_MODEL             = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
}
```

### `python` not on PATH?

Replace `"command": "python"` with the full interpreter path:

```bash
which python3   # macOS / Linux
where python    # Windows
```

e.g. `/usr/local/bin/python3` or `C:\Python311\python.exe`.

### Verify it works

After restarting your client, ask the agent:

> *"Store a note: we're using PostgreSQL for this project."*

Then open a **fresh session** and ask:

> *"What database are we using?"*

If it remembers — you're live. 🎉

### Quick-reference tool table

| Ask the agent… | Tool called |
|---|---|
| *"Remember that…"* | `observe_conversation` |
| *"What do you know about X?"* | `query_graph` |
| *"What changed recently?"* | `graph_diff` |
| *"Summarize context for a new session"* | `prime_context` |
| *"Show all stored topics"* | `get_topics` |
| *"Export my memory to a file"* | `export_graph_backup` |

For the full tool surface and environment variable reference see [docs/reference.md](./docs/reference.md).

## Using It In MCP Clients

Once Waggle is installed in an MCP client, people normally do not run `waggle-mcp` commands by hand during everyday use. They talk to the agent normally, and the agent uses Waggle's MCP tools to store and retrieve memory.

### Codex

Typical pattern:
- You work in a normal Codex thread.
- Codex calls `observe_conversation`, `store_node`, `store_edge`, `query_graph`, or `prime_context` when memory is useful.
- On a later task, Codex can pull back the connected subgraph instead of relying on the current chat window alone.

Example:
- You say: `Remember that we chose PostgreSQL because MySQL replication was painful.`
- Codex stores that as structured memory.
- Days later you ask: `What did we decide about the database?`
- Codex can call `query_graph` and recover the earlier decision plus its reason.

### Claude Code

Typical pattern:
- You configure Waggle as an MCP server in Claude Code.
- Claude Code uses Waggle tools to persist decisions, preferences, architecture notes, and project state across sessions.
- `prime_context` and `export_context_bundle` are useful when starting a fresh task or handing context to another model.

### Cursor

Typical pattern:
- Cursor uses Waggle over MCP while you work in the editor.
- Facts and decisions can be saved as graph memory instead of getting lost in past chats.
- Later questions like `why did we change this?` or `what superseded this decision?` can be answered from connected nodes and edges.

### Antigravity

Typical pattern:
- Antigravity can use Waggle as its persistent memory backend through MCP.
- Conversation turns can be extracted with `observe_conversation`.
- Linked context can be exported with `export_context_bundle` or edited through the Markdown vault workflow.

For a built-in CLI explanation of the feature surface, run:

```bash
waggle-mcp features
```

## See it in action

**Session 1** — April 10
```text
User:  Let's use PostgreSQL. MySQL replication has been painful.
Agent: [calls observe_conversation()]
       → stores decision node: "Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL"
       → stores reason node:   "MySQL replication painful"
       → links them with a depends_on edge
```

**Session 2** — April 12 (fresh context window, no history)
```text
User:  What did we decide about the database?
Agent: [calls query_graph("database decision")]
       → retrieves the decision node + linked reason from April 10

       "You decided on PostgreSQL on April 10. The reason recorded was
        that MySQL replication had been painful."
```

**Session 3** — April 14
```text
User:  Actually, let's reconsider — the team is more familiar with MySQL.
Agent: [calls store_node() + store_edge(new_node → old_node, "contradicts")]
       → both positions are preserved, and the contradiction is explicit
```

---

## Key Features

- **Automatic Extraction**: `observe_conversation` ingests facts into the graph without manual schema work.
- **Portable Context**: `export_context_bundle` generates Markdown/JSON context packs for another AI.
- **Vault Round-trip**: `export_markdown_vault` / `import_markdown_vault` for Obsidian-style node editing.
- **Conflict Resolution**: `list_conflicts` / `resolve_conflict` to manage contradictions without losing history.
- **Deterministic Fallback**: Stable SHA-256 hashing for reliable, reproducible offline operation when transformer models are unavailable.

## Benchmarks & Verification

### External Benchmark — LongMemEval

**`81.6% R@5` on the held-out split (500 questions).** This is the number that matters for generalization — it was not used during development.

The full-split ceiling is `97.4% R@5` (retrieval on the saved benchmark setup), included for completeness in [tests/artifacts/README.md](./tests/artifacts/README.md). The gap reflects the difference between in-distribution retrieval and held-out generalization — both numbers are real, the held-out one is the honest one.

### Internal Fixtures

| Area | Corpus | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Extraction | 25-case deterministic fixture | `100.0%` |
| Retrieval | 18-query retrieval fixture | `83.3% Hit@k` |
| Query stress | 40 adversarial retrieval-only cases | `97.5% Hit@k`, `97.5% exact support` |
| Deduplication | 22 cases (semi-semantic) | `0` false merges at threshold; `77.3%` overall (conservative false negatives — improving in 0.1.8) |
| Automated tests | Infrastructure & logic | `91 passed` |

**Deduplication note:** Zero false-positive merges is the safety invariant. The 77.3% overall accuracy is intentionally conservative — the system prefers a missed merge over a wrong merge. Improving recall without introducing false positives is the active work for 0.1.8.

## Known Limitations

- **Best on structured recall, weaker on answer synthesis**: Waggle is strongest at "retrieve the right facts and relationships" — not at emitting a single benchmark-formatted final answer from memory.
- **Edges are load-bearing**: `observe_conversation` and `decompose_and_store` create them automatically. Raw `store_node` calls without follow-up edges produce disconnected nodes with no traversal value.
- **Graph retrieval trades tokens for reasoning context**: factual lookups are often cheaper than chunked RAG; graph-expansion queries intentionally spend more tokens to carry update chains and contradictions.
- **Deduplication recall is conservative (77.3%)**: zero false-positive merges is maintained, but recall will improve in 0.1.8.
